  [fm_bin,S_unc,id_unc,T,stats] = CALCULATE_FLUX_MODES(S,c,'PropertyName',PropertyValue,...)
   This function calculates the elementary flux modes, extreme pathways, or
   minimal generating sets of the stoichiometric matrix S with constraints
   c, where c(i) = 1 for reversible reactions, c(i) = 0 for irreversible
   reactions, and c(i) = -1 for zero (blocked) reactions. As output the
   binary steady state flux modes fm_bin are returned and the coefficients
   (S_unc) and identifiers (id_unc) of the unconstrained reactions and/or
   compounds. Unconstrained reactions/compounds include pre-defined ones
   using the 'ReactionsUnconstrained' and 'CompoundsUnconstrained' option,
   and the remaining reactions/compounds on which no constraint could be
   imposed because the number of intermediate flux modes surpassed
   'MaxIntermediates' or because not enough memory was available to start a
   new iteration. The first row of id_unc indicates whether the identifier
   refers to a compound (1) or reaction (2), and the second row gives the
   compound/reaction index. If the compression option is used, T will
   return the transformation matrix such that the compressed stoichiometric
   matrix is equal to S*T. Importantly, the reaction indices in id_unc
   refer to the columns in the compressed matrix S*T. If full compression
   is used, it is possible that certain flux modes cannot be decompressed;
   in this case the corresponding colums in fm_bin have a value of -128.
   Finally, statistics of the computation are given in the stats table.
 
  [fm_bin,S_unc,id_unc,T,stats] = CALCULATE_FLUX_MODES('.../current_run.mat')
   In case the automatic subdivsion strategy is used, the intermediate
   results will be saved after completion of the flux mode computation of
   each subnetwork ('fm_bin.dat', 'S_unc.dat' and 'current_run.mat' file).
   If the next iteration gets interrupted, it can be resumed by running
   CALCULATE_FLUX_MODES with as argument the location of the
   'current_run.mat' file.
 
   In order for the out-of-memory detection routine to work optimally, it 
   is strongly advised that virtual memory is turned off by setting the 
   page file size to zero (Windows) or disabling swapping (Linux).
 
   CALCULATE_FLUX_MODES accepts the following input arguments:
    'ReactionsUnconstrained' - Indices of the reactions that have to remain
                               unconstrained. For elementary flux modes no
                               reactions are unconstrained (default), for
                               extreme pathways reversible boundary
                               reactions are unconstrained, for minimal
                               generating sets all reversible reactions are
                               unconstrained.
    'CompoundsUnconstrained' - Indices of the (hub) compounds on which the
                               steady state constraint will not be imposed.
    'ReactionOrder' / - Numeric vectors for determining the order in which
    'CompoundOrder'     reaction/compound constraints are imposed. For
                        the nullspace approach compound constraints are
                        resolved first, so CompoundOrder must be a zero
                        vector and ReactionOrder an all-one vector
                        (default). For the canonical basis approach
                        reaction constraints are resolved first, so
                        ReactionOrder must be all zeros and CompoundOrder
                        all ones. Custom strategies for determining the
                        iteration order are possible by giving ReactionOrder 
                        and CompoundOrder any given range of values.
    'MaxIntermediates' - Maximum number of intermediate flux modes: if
                         this number is reached the algorithm will stop and
                         return the intermediate results. Default value is
                         Inf. In the case an array with two numbers is
                         given, the algorithm will automatically subdivide
                         the network for the remaining constraints once the
                         first threshold MaxIntermediates(1) has been
                         reached, or if not enough memory is available to
                         proceed. Subsequently flux modes will be
                         determined in the subdivided networks and results
                         will be written to the harddrive (see 'Dir'
                         option). If the second threshold MaxIntermediates(2) 
                         has been surpassed, the algorithm will stop.
    'Compression' - Perform flux mode analysis on the compressed
                    stoichiometric matrix; options are 'full' (default),
                    'partial' and 'off'. Full compression maximally reduces
                    the number of reactions, but it may not always be
                    possible to decompress intermediate flux modes, i.e.
                    in case the algorithm has stopped because the maximum
                    number of flux modes has been reached or insufficient
                    memory was available. In contrast, partial compression
                    will ensure that also intermediate flux modes can be
                    decompressed.
    'StaticOrder' - Strategy that determines the order with which the 
                    constraints are resolved in the double description
                    method; default 'MaxZero,AbsLexMin'. StaticOrder is 
                    determined before the main iteration. The following 
                    options exist:
                    'MinZero' - minimum number of zeros
                    'MaxZero' - maximum number of zeros
                    'MinNeg' - minimum number of negative coefficients
                    'MaxNeg' - maximum number of negative coefficients
                    'MinPos' - minimum number of positive coefficients
                    'MaxPos' - maximum number of positive coefficients
                    'MinComb' - minimum number of combinations between 
                                positive and negative coefficients
                    'MaxComb' - maximum number of combinations between 
                                positive and negative coefficients
                    'MinMinPosNeg' - minimum number of positive or 
                                     negative coefficients, depending on 
                                     which is the smallest number
                    'LexMin' - lexicographic order
                    'LexMax' - inverted lexicographic order
                    'AbsLexMin' - lexicographic order of the absolute 
                                  coefficient values
                    'AbsLexMax' - inverted lexicographic order of the 
                                  absolute coefficient values
                    'Random' - random order
                    '' - no static order; see 'DynamicOrder'
                    NB A combination of ordering strategies can be used
                    by separating each strategy by a comma.
    'DynamicOrder' - Strategy that determines the order with which the 
                     constraints are resolved in the double description
                     method; default 'MinComb'. 'DynamicOrder' is
                     determined during the main iteration of the double
                     description method and is conditional on 'StaticOrder'. 
                     In case only dynamic ordering has to be used,
                     'StaticOrder' has to be set to ''. For 'DynamicOrder' 
                     the same options exist as for 'StaticOrder', except 
                     'LexMin', 'LexMax', 'AbsLexMin', 'AbsLexMax' and 
                     'Random'.
    'Display' - Level of verbosity; options are 'iter' (default) for
                showing statistics at each iteration, 'on' for showing
                only general messages, or else 'off' for silent mode.
    'Tolerance' - Relative threshold under which floating point
                  coefficients will be rounded off to zero or to the
                  closest fraction; default value is 1e-10.
    'Dir' - Directory on the harddrive to store intermediate solutions when
            using the automatic splitting option or when the uncompressed
            flux modes do not fit in the memory. In the case multiple media
            are available with different access speeds, one should pass a
            cell with two path names of which the first refers to a
            directory on a fast medium (typically the internal harddrive)
            and the second to a directory on a slower medium, but with
            larger storage (e.g. external harddrive).
    'MinAvailableMemory' - Minimal amount (MBs) of memory that has to be 
                           available for basic operations; default is 1024
                           MB. Increase this value if out-of-memory
                           detection does not work and an out-of-memory
                           error is given. 
    'MaxAvailableMemory' - Maximal total amount (MBs) of memory that is  
                           available for performing flux mode calculation.
                           Value can be set to Inf if no upper limit of 
                           memory use is required. 
    'MaxThreads' - Maximum number of threads that is used in the adjacency
                   test. If MaxThreads is larger than the number of logical
                   processor cores the latter number will be taken instead.  
    'LPsolver' - Name of the linear programming solver that is used for 
                 network compression; default 'none'. See the LP_SOLVE 
                 function for the options.
    'SSE4' - Option to indicate whether the current CPU supports the SSE4
             instruction set; default 'auto', else 'off'. If supported, the
             pruning function will calculate the number of nonzero elements
             using the internal popcnt instruction, which is approximately
             1.5 times faster than lookup tables.

  [fm,err] = BIN2NUM_FLUX_MODES(fm_bin,S)
   This function calculates the coefficients of the binary/ternary flux
   modes (fm_bin) such that S*fm=0 and fm_bin=sign(fm), with S the
   stoichiometric matrix. Importantly, if fm_bin represent intermediate
   flux modes for which not all compounds have been constrained to zero
   steady state, only the constrained rows of S must be included. Indices
   of the constrained compounds are given in the stats.id variable that is
   returned by the CALCULATE_FLUX_MODES function. The indices of
   inconsistent binary flux modes are returned in the cell array err, with
   in the first column the index of the flux mode and in the second column
   the error messsage.
